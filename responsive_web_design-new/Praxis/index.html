<!-- Step 6
HTML elements are often nested within other HTML elements. In the previous step you nested the h2 element, comment and p element within the main element. A nested element is a child of its parent element.
To make HTML easier to read, indent the h2 element, the comment, and p element exactly two spaces to indicate they are children of the main element. -->
