<!-- Step 10
You can link to another page with the anchor (a) element. For example, <a href='https://freecodecamp.org'></a> would link to freecodecamp.org.
Add an anchor element after the paragraph that links to https://freecatphotoapp.com. At this point, the link wonâ€™t show up in the preview. -->
<!-- Step 11
A link's text must be placed between the opening and closing tags of an anchor (a) element. For example, <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">click here to go to freeCodeCamp.org</a> is a link with the text click here to go to freeCodeCamp.org.
Add the anchor text cat photos to the anchor element. This will become the link's text. -->
<!-- Step 12
Turn the words cat photos located inside p element into a link using the same value for the href attribute as the link below the p element. The p element should show the same text in the browser, but the words cat photos should now be a link. Make sure to remove the a element with the text cat photos on the line below the p element. -->
<!-- Step 13
Add a target attribute with the value _blank to the anchor (a) element's opening tag, so that the link opens in a new tab. -->
<!-- Step 14
Turn the image into a link by surrounding it with necessary element tags. Use https://freecatphotoapp.com as the anchor's href attribute value. -->
