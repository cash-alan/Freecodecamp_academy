<!-- Step 15
Before adding any new content, you should make use of a section element to separate the cat photos content from the future content.
Take all the elements currently located within the main element and nest them in a section element. -->
<!-- Step 16
It is time to add a new section. Add a second section element below the existing section element. -->
<!-- Step 17
Within the second section element, add a new h2 element with the text Cat Lists. -->
<!-- Step 18
When you add a lower rank heading element to the page, it's implied that you're starting a new subsection.
After the last h2 element of the second section element, add an h3 element with the text Things cats love:. -->
