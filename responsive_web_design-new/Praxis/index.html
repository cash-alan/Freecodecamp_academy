<!-- Step 16
Now that you have the CSS in the styles.css file, go ahead and remove the style element and all its content. Once it is removed, the text that was centered will shift back to the left. -->
<!-- Step 17
Now you need to link the styles.css file so the styles will be applied again.
Nest a self-closing link element in the head element. Give it a rel attribute value stylesheet, a type attribute value of text/css, and an href attribute value of styles.css. -->
<!-- Step 18
For the styling of the page to look similar on mobile as it does on a desktop or laptop, you need to add a meta element with a special content attribute.
Add the following within the head element:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /> -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Cafe Menu</title>
    <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>CAMPER CAFE</h1>
      <p>Est. 2020</p>
    </header>
      <main>
        <section>
          <h2>Coffee</h2>
        </section>
      </main>
    </body>
</html>
