<!-- Step 10
As suggested by the title, you are creating a form. So, after the p element, insert a form with an action attribute targeting https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org. -->
<!-- Step 11
Seeing as we plan on having three distinct sections to the form, add three fieldset elements within the form. -->
<!-- Step 12
The first fieldset will hold name, email, and password fields. Start by adding four label elements to the first fieldset. -->
<!-- Step 13
Add the following text to the label elements:
    Enter Your First Name:
    Enter Your Last Name:
    Enter Your Email:
    Create a New Password: -->
<!-- Step 15
Nest an input element within each label. Be sure to add each input after the label text, and include a space after the colon. -->
<!-- Step 16
Specifying the type attribute of a form element is important for the browser to know what kind of data it should expect. If the type is not specified, the browser will default to text.
Give the first two input elements a type attribute of text, the third a type attribute of email, and the fourth a type attribute of password.
The email type only allows emails with a @ and a . in the domain. The password type obscures the input, and warns if the site does not use HTTPS. -->
<!-- Step 17
The first input element with a type of submit is automatically set to submit its nearest parent form element.
To handle the form submission, after the last fieldset element add an input element with the type attribute set to submit and the value attribute set to Submit. -->
<!-- Step 18
At this point, you should be able to submit the form. However, you might notice not much happens.
To make the form more interactive, add the required attribute to the input elements in the first fieldset.
Now, if you try to submit the form without filling in the required fields, you will see an error message. -->
<!-- Step 19
Certain type attribute values come with built-in form validation. For example, type="email" requires that the value be a valid email address.
Add custom validation to the password input element, by adding a minlength attribute with a value of 8. Doing so prevents inputs of less than 8 characters being submitted. -->
<!-- Step 20
With type="password" you can use the pattern attribute to define a regular expression that the password must match to be considered valid.
Add a pattern attribute to the password input element to require the input match: [a-z0-5]{8,}
The above is a regular expression which matches eight or more lowercase letters or the digits 0 to 5. Then, remove the minlength attribute, and try it out. -->
