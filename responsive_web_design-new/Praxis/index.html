<!-- Step 21
Let us go to the next part of the registration form. This section will ask for the type of account the user is opening, and will confirm the user has read the terms and conditions.
Start by adding three label elements to the second fieldset. -->
<!-- Step 22
Users will be allowed to chose either a Personal Account or Business Account.
To do this, within each of the first two label elements, add one input element with type="radio". -->
<!-- Step 23
For the terms and conditions, add an input with a type of checkbox to the third label element. Also, as we do not want users to sign up, without having read the terms and conditions, make it required. -->
<!-- Step 24
Within each corresponding label element, and immediately after the input element, add a space and add the following text:
  Personal Account
  Business Account
  I accept the terms and conditions -->
<!-- Step 25
You only want one radio input to be selectable at a time. However, the form does not know the radio inputs are related.
To relate the radio inputs, give them the same name attribute with a value of account-type. Now, it is not possible to select both radio inputs at the same time. -->
<!-- Step 26
To finish this fieldset off, link the text terms and conditions to the following location:
