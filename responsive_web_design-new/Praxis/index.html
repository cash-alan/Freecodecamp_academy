<!-- Step 1
Welcome to the Registration Form project! Start by adding the !DOCTYPE html declaration at the top of the document so the browser knows what type of document it's reading. -->
<!-- Step 2
Add opening and closing html tags below the DOCTYPE so you have a place to start putting some code. -->
<!-- Step 3
Next, add opening and closing head and body tags within the html element. -->
<!-- Step 4
Add a title element to the head, and give your project a title of Registration Form. Also, nest a self-closing link element in the head element. Give it a rel attribute value of stylesheet, a type attribute value of text/css, and an href attribute value of styles.css. -->
<!-- Step 5
Within the body, provide a heading context for the content, by adding an h1 with the text Registration Form. -->
<!-- Step 6
Below the heading, use the following text within a paragraph element to encourage users to register:
Please fill out this form with the required information -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Registration Form</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" type="text/css"/>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Registration Form</h1>
    <p>Please fill out this form with the required information</p>
