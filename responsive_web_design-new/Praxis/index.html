<!-- Step 12
You can add style to an element by specifying it in the style element and setting a property for it like this:
element {
 property: value;
}
Center your h1 element by setting its text-align property to the value center. -->
<!-- Step 13
In the previous step, you used a type selector to style the h1 element. Go ahead and center the h2 and p elements with a new type selector for each one. -->
<!-- Step 14
You now have three type selectors with the exact same styling. You can add the same group of styles to many elements by creating a list of selectors. Each selector is separated with commas like this:
selector1, selector2 {
  property: value;
}
Use a selector list to center the h1, h2 and p elements at the same time. -->
<!-- Step 15
You have styled three elements by writing CSS inside the style tags. This works, but since there will be many more styles, it's best to put all the styles in a separate file and link to it.
We have created a separate styles.css file for you and switched the editor view to that file. You can change between files with the tabs at the top of the editor.
Start by rewriting the styles you have created into the styles.css file. Make sure to exclude the opening and closing style tags. -->
