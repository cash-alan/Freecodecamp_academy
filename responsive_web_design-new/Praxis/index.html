<!-- Step 32
It is time to add a new section. Add a third section element below the second section element. -->
<!-- Step 33
Inside the third section element add an h2 element with the text Cat Form. -->
<!-- Step 34
Now you will add a web form to collect information from users.
After the Cat Form heading, add a form element. -->
<!-- Step 35
The action attribute indicates where form data should be sent. For example, <form action="/submit-url"></form> tells the browser that the form data should be sent to the path /submit-url.
Add an action attribute with the value https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo to the form element. -->
<!-- Step 36
The input element allows you several ways to collect data from a web form. Like img elements, input elements are self-closing and do not need closing tags.
Nest an input element in the form element. -->
<!-- Step 37
There are many kinds of inputs you can create using the type attribute. You can easily create a password field, reset button, or a control to let users select a file from their computer.
Create a text field to get text input from a user by adding the type attribute with the value text to the input element. -->
<!-- Step 38
In order for a form's data to be accessed by the location specified in the action attribute, you must give the text field a name attribute and assign it a value to represent the data being submitted. For example, you could use the following syntax for an email address text field: <input type="text" name="email">.
Add the name attribute with the value catphotourl to your text field. -->
<!-- Step 39
Placeholder text is used to give people a hint about what kind of information to enter into an input. For example, <input type="text" placeholder="Email address">.
Add the placeholder text cat photo URL to your input element. -->
<!-- Step 40
To prevent a user from submitting your form when required information is missing, you need to add the required attribute to an input element. There's no need to set a value to the required attribute. Instead, just add the word required to the input element, making sure there is space between it and other attributes. -->
