<!-- Step 6
Add a div element in the body.
Set the class attribute equal to canvas. For example, <div class="my-div">.
This will act as the canvas for your painting. -->
<!-- Step 7
Before you can start styling the div you added, you need to link your CSS to your HTML.
Add a link element to link your styles.css file. Set the href to ./styles.css, and remember to set the rel attribute to stylesheet. -->
<!-- Step 11
Every painting needs a frame.
Wrap the .canvas element in another div. Give that div the frame class. -->
<!-- Step 16
Add a new div element inside of your .canvas element.
Give the new div the class attribute with a value of one. This will be your first rectangle. -->
<!-- Step 23
Add another div with a class value of two just below your one element. This will be your second rectangle. -->
<!-- Step 28
Create a new div with a class value of three right under the .two element. This will be your third rectangle. -->
