<!-- Step 70
Now that the markers have the correct colors, it's time to build the marker sleeves. Start with the red marker.
Inside the red marker div, create a new div and give it a class of sleeve. -->
<!-- Step 76
Your sleeve is looking good, but it would look even better if it was positioned more toward the right side of the marker. One way to do that is to add another element before the sleeve to push it to the right.
Add a new div with the class cap before the sleeve div element. -->
