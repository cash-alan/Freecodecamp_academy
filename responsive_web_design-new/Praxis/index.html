  <!-- Step 27
  Moving on to the final fieldset. What if you wanted to allow a user to upload a profile picture?
  Well, the input type file allows just that. Add a label with the text Upload a profile picture: , and add an input accepting a file upload. -->
  <!-- Step 28
  Add another label after the first, with the text Input your age (years): . Then, nest an input with the type of number.
  As we do not want users under the age of 13 to register, add a min attribute to the input with a value of 13. Also, we can probably assume users over the age of 120 will not register; add a max attribute with a value of 120.
  Now, if someone tries to submit the form with values outside of the range, a warning will appear, and the form will not submit. Give it a try. -->
  <!-- Step 29
  Adding a dropdown to the form is easy with the select element. The select element is a container for a group of option elements, and the option element acts as a label for each dropdown option. Both elements require closing tags.
  Start, by adding a select element below the two label elements. Then, nest 5 option elements within the select element. -->
  <!-- Step 30
  Nest the select element within a label element with the text How did you hear about us?. The text should come before the select element. -->
  <!-- Step 31
  The dropdown options are currently empty. To give them content, add the following text to each subsequent option element:
    (select one)
    freeCodeCamp News
    freeCodeCamp YouTube Channel
    freeCodeCamp Forum
    Other -->
  <!-- Step 32
  Submitting the form with an option selected would not send a useful value to the server. As such, each option needs to be given a value attribute. Without which, the text content of the option will be submitted to the server.
  Give the first option a value of "", and the subsequent option elements value attributes from 1 to 4. -->
  <!-- Step 33
  The textarea element acts like an input element of type text, but comes with the added benefit of being able to receive multi-line text, and an initial number of text rows and columns.
  To allow users to register with a bio, add a label with the text Provide a bio: followed by a textarea element, which requires a closing tag. -->
  <!-- Step 34
  The textarea appears too small. To give it an initial size, you can add the rows and cols attributes.
  Add an initial size of 3 rows and 30 columns. -->
  <!-- Step 35
  To give Campers an idea of what to put in their bio, the placeholder attribute is used. The placeholder accepts a text value, which is displayed until the user starts typing.
  Give the textarea a placeholder of I like coding on the beach.... -->
  <!-- Step 36
  With form submissions, it is useful, and good practice, to provide each submittable element with a name attribute. This attribute is used to identify the element in the form submission.
  Go ahead, and give each submittable element a unique name attribute of your choosing. Except for the two radio inputs. -->
