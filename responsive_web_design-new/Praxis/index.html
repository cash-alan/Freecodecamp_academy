<!-- Step 28
To apply the class's styling to the div element, add a class attribute to the div element's opening tag and set its value to menu. -->
<!-- Step 30
Itâ€™s looking good. Time to start adding some menu items. Add an empty article element under the Coffee heading. It will contain a flavor and price of each coffee you currently offer. */ -->
<!-- Step 31
article elements commonly contain multiple elements that have related information. In this case, it will contain a coffee flavor and a price for that flavor. Nest two p elements inside your article element. The first one's text should be French Vanilla, and the second's text 3.00. -->
<!-- Step 32
Starting below the existing coffee/price pair, add the following coffee and prices using article elements with two nested p elements inside each. As before, the first p element's text should contain the coffee flavor and the second p element's text should contain the price. 
Caramel Macchiato 3.75
Pumpkin Spice 3.50
Hazelnut 4.00
Mocha 4.50
-->
<!-- Step 33
The flavors and prices are currently stacked on top of each other and centered with their respective p elements. It would be nice if the flavor was on the left and the price was on the right.
Add the class name flavor to the French Vanilla p element. -->
<!-- Step 35
Next, you want to align the price to the right. Add a class named price to your p element that has 3.00 as its text. -->
<!-- Step 37
That is kind of what you want, but now it would be nice if the flavor and price were on the same line. p elements are block-level elements, so they take up the entire width of their parent element.
To get them on the same line, you need to apply some styling to the p elements, so they behave more like inline elements. Add a class attribute with the value item to the first article element under the Coffee heading. -->
<!-- Step 41
That worked, but there is still a little space on the right of the price.
You could keep trying various percentages for the widths. Instead, simply move the price p element to be on the same line and make sure there is no space between them. -->
<!-- Step 43
Now that you know it works, you can change the remaining article and p elements to match the first set. Start by adding the class item to the other article elements. -->
<!-- Step 44
Next, position the other p elements to be on the same line with no space between them. -->
<!-- Step 45
To complete the styling, add the applicable class names flavor and price to all the remaining p elements. -->
<!-- Step 47
You will come back to styling the menu in a few steps, but for now, go ahead and add a second section element below the first for displaying the desserts offered by the cafe. -->
<!-- Step 48
Add an h2 element in the new section and give it the text Desserts. -->
<!-- Step 49
Add an empty article element under the Desserts heading. Give it a class attribute with the value item. -->
<!-- Step 51
For the two p elements you just added, add dessert as the value of the first p element's class attribute and the value price as the second p elements class attribute. -->
<!-- Step 53
Below the dessert you just added, add the rest of the desserts and prices using three more article elements, each with two nested p elements. Each element should have the correct dessert and price text, and all of them should have the correct classes.
Cherry Pie 2.75
Cheesecake 3.00
Cinnamon Roll 2.50 -->
