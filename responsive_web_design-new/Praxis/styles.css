/* Step 8
A useful property of an SVG (scalable vector graphics) is that it contains a path attribute which allows the image to be scaled without affecting the resolution of the resultant image.
Currently, the img is assuming it's default size, which is too large. Correctly, scale the image using it's id as a selector, and setting the width to max(100px, 18vw). */
/* Step 9
As described in the freeCodeCamp Style Guide, the logo should retain an aspect ratio of 35 / 4, and have padding around the text.
First, change the background-color to #0a0a23 so you can see the logo. Then, use the aspect-ratio property to set the desired aspect ratio to 35 / 4. Finally, add a padding of 0.4rem all around. */
/* Step 10
Make the header take up the full width of its parent container, set it's height to 50px, and set the background-color to #1b1b32. Then, set the display to use Flexbox. */
/* Step 11
Change the h1 font color to #f1be32, and set the font size to min(5vw, 1.2em). */
/* Step 13
Target unordered list elements within nav elements, and use Flexbox to evenly space the children. */
