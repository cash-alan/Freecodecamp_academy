/* Step 19
The text is centered again so the link to the CSS file is working. Add another style to the file that changes the background-color property to brown for the body element. */
/* Step 20
That brown background makes it hard to read the text. Change the body element's background color to be burlywood so it has some color but you are still be able to read the text. */

body {
  background-color: burlywood;
}
h1, h2, p {
    text-align: center;
}
