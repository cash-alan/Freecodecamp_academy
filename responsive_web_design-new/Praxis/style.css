/* Step 34
The colors and shapes of your painting are too sharp to pass as a Rothko.
Use the filter property to blur the painting by 2px in the .canvas element. */
/* Step 35
Create a rule that targets both .one and .two and increase their blur effect by 1 pixel.
Here's an example of a rule that increases the blur of two elements:
`h1, p {
  filter: blur(3px);
}` */
/* Step 36
Increase the blur of .three by 2 pixels. */
/* Step 37
The rectangles are too small and their edges don't have the soft quality of a painting.
Increase the area and soften the edges of .one by setting its box-shadow to 0 0 3px 3px #efb762. */
/* Step 38
Use the same box-shadow declaration for .two, but change the color from #efb762 to #8f0401. */
/* Step 39
Add a box-shadow to .three with the values 0 0 5px 5px #b20403. */
/* Step 40
The corners of each rectangle are still too sharp.
Round each corner of the .one element by 9 pixels, using the border-radius property. */
/* Step 41
Use the border-radius property on the .two selector, to set its top-left and bottom-right radii to 8px, and top-right and bottom-left radii to 10px. */
/* Step 42
The border-radius property accepts up to four values to round the top-left, top-right, bottom-right, and bottom-left corners.
Round the top-left corner of .three by 30 pixels, the top-right by 25 pixels, the bottom-right by 60 pixels, and bottom-left by 12 pixels. */
/* Step 43
Rotate each rectangle to give them more of an imperfect, hand-painted look.
Use the transform property on the .one selector to rotate it counter clockwise by 0.6 degrees. */
/* Step 44
Rotate the .two element clockwise by 0.4 degrees. */
/* Step 45
Rotate .three counter clockwise by 0.2 degrees.
With this final step, your Rothko painting is now complete. */
