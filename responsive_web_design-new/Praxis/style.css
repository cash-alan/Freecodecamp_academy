/* Step 78
Next you are going to be styling the footer element. To keep the CSS organized, add a comment at the end of styles.css with the text FOOTER. */
/* Step 79
Moving down to the footer element, make all the text have a value of 14px for the font size. */
/* Step 80
The default color of a link that has not yet been clicked on is typically blue. The default color of a link that has already been visited from a page is typically purple.
To make the footer links the same color regardless if a link has been visited, use a type selector for the anchor element (a) and use the value black for the color property. */
/* Step 81
You change properties of a link when the link has actually been visited by using a pseudo-selector that looks like a:visited { propertyName: propertyValue; }.
Change the color of the footer Visit our website link to be grey when a user has visited the link. */
/* Step 82
You change properties of a link when the mouse hovers over them by using a pseudo-selector that looks like a:hover { propertyName: propertyValue; }.
Change the color of the footer Visit our website link to be brown when a user hovers over it. */
/* Step 84
To keep with the same color theme you have already been using (black and brown), change the color for when the link is visited to black and use brown for when the link is actually clicked. */
/* Step 84
To keep with the same color theme you have already been using (black and brown), change the color for when the link is visited to black and use brown for when the link is actually clicked. */
/* Step 85
The menu text CAMPER CAFE has a different space from the top than the address's space at the bottom of the menu. This is due to the browser having some default top margin for the h1 element.
Change the top margin of the h1 element to 0 to remove all the top margin. */
/* Step 86
To remove some of the vertical space between the h1 element and the text Est. 2020, change the bottom margin of the h1 to 15px */
/* Step 87
Now the top spacing looks good. The space below the address at the bottom of the menu is a little bigger than the space at the top of the menu and the h1 element.
To decrease the default margin space below the address p element, create a class selector named address and use the value 5px for the margin-bottom property. */
/* Step 90
The image you added is not centered horizontally like the Coffee heading above it. img elements are "like" inline elements.
To make the image behave like heading elements (which are block-level), create an img type selector and use the value block for the display property and use the applicable margin-left and margin-right values to center it horizontally. */
/* Step 92
It would be nice if the vertical space between the h2 elements and their associated icons was smaller. The h2 elements have default top and bottom margin space, so you could change the bottom margin of the h2 elements to say 0 or another number.
There is an easier way, simply add a negative top margin to the img elements to pull them up from their current positions. Negative values are created using a - in front of the value. To complete this project, go ahead and use a negative top margin of 25px in the img type selector. */
