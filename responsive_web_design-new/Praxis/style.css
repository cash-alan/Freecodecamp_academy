/* Step 37
The HTML for the registration form is finished. Now, you can spruce it up a bit.
Start by changing the font to Tahoma, and the font size to 16px in the body. */
/* Step 38
Center the h1 and p elements by giving them a margin of 1em auto. Then, align their text in the center as well. */
/* tep 39
Center the form element, by giving it a margin of 0 auto. Then, fix its size to a maximum width of 500px, and a minimum width of 300px. In between that range, allow it to have a width of 60vw. */
/* Step 40
During development, it is useful to see the fieldset default borders. However, they make the content appear too separated.
Remove the border, and add 2rem of padding only to the top and bottom of each fieldset. Be sure to remove the padding from the left and right. */
/* Step 41
To give the fieldset elements a bit of separation, select all but the last fieldset element, and give them a border-bottom of 3px solid #3b3b4f. */
/* Step 42
It would be nicer to have the label text appear above the form elements.
Select all input, textarea, and select elements, and make them take up the full width of their parent elements.
Also, add 10px of margin to the top of the selected elements. Set the other margins to 0. */
/* Step 44
Select only the .inline elements, and give them width of unset. This will remove the earlier rule which set all the input elements to width: 100%. */
/* Step 45
Add some space between the .inline elements and the label text, by giving a right margin of 0.5em. Also, set all the other margin to 0. */
/* Step 46
If you look close enough, you will notice the .inline elements are too high on the line.
To combat this, set the vertical-align property to middle. */
/* Step 47
To make the input and textarea elements blend in with the background theme, set their background-color to #0a0a23. Then, give them a 1px, solid border with a color of #0a0a23. */
/* Step 48
Currently, if you type in the input or textarea elements, you will not be able to see the text. Also, their height is too small to be easy to use.
Fix this, by setting the color to #ffffff, and setting their min-height to 2em. */
/* Step 49
You want the select element to remain with a white background, but now it is not getting the same min-height as the input and textarea elements.
Move the min-height property and value so that all three element types have the same min-height value, and the select element still has a white background. */
