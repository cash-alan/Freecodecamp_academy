/* Step 35
Now that you've gone through all the primary, secondary, and tertiary colors on a color wheel, it'll be easier to understand other color theory concepts and how they impact design.
First, in the rules .one, .two, and .three, adjust the values in the rgb function so that the background-color of each element is set to pure black. Remember that the rgb function uses the additive color model, where colors start as black and change as the values of red, green, and blue increase. */
/* Step 36
A color wheel is a circle where similar colors, or hues, are near each other, and different ones are further apart. For example, pure red is between the hues rose and orange.
Two colors that are opposite from each other on the color wheel are called complementary colors. If two complementary colors are combined, they produce gray. But when they are placed side-by-side, these colors produce strong visual contrast and appear brighter.
In the rgb function for the .one CSS rule, set the red value to the max of 255 to produce pure red. In the rgb function for .two CSS rule, set the values for green and blue to the max of 255 to produce cyan. */
/* Step 37
Notice that the red and cyan colors are very bright right next to each other. This contrast can be distracting if it's overused on a website, and can make text hard to read if it's placed on a complementary-colored background.
It's better practice to choose one color as the dominant color, and use its complementary color as an accent to bring attention to certain content on the page.
First, in the h1 rule, use the rgb function to set its background color to cyan. */
/* Step 38
Next, in the .one rule, use the rgb function to set the background-color to black. And in the .two rule, use the rgb function to set the background-color to red. */
/* Step 39
Notice how your eyes are naturally drawn to the red color in the center? When designing a site, you can use this effect to draw attention to important headings, buttons, or links.
There are several other important color combinations outside of complementary colors, but you'll learn those a bit later.
For now, use the rgb function in the .two rule to set the background-color to black. */
/* Step 40
And in the h1 rule, remove the background-color property and value to go back to the default white color. */
/* Step 42
Update the .one class selector to target the new red class. */
/* Step 43
And update the rgb function in the .red rule so that the red value is at the max. */
/* Step 45
Update the CSS class selector .two so it targets the new green class. And update the .three selector so it targets the new blue class. */
