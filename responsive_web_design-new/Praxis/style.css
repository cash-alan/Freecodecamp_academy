/* Step 7
To spruce the project up, let us add some CSS. Begin by giving the body a width of 100%, and a height of 100vh. */
/* Step 8
Now, get rid of the horizontal scroll-bar, by setting the body default margin added by some browsers to 0. */
/* Step 9
That is better. Now, make the background easy on the eyes, by changing the body background-color to #1b1b32. Then, to see the text, change the color to #f5f6f7. */
/* Step 14
As label elements are inline by default, they appear on the same line as the text they are labelling. To make them appear on separate lines, add display: block to the label element, and add a margin of 0.5rem 0, to separate them from each other. */

  width: 100%;

  background-color: #1b1b32;
  color: #f5f6f7;

label {
  display: block;
