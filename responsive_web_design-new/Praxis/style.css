Normalize your box model by creating a * selector and setting the box-sizing property to border-box. */
/* Step 8
Your images are currently too large, and you will not be able to see your CSS changes.
Create a #gallery img selector to target your images. Give it a width property set to 25%.
Also set the height property to 300px to keep your images a uniform size. */
/* Step 9
Remove the margin from your body element, set the font to Arial, and give it a background color of #EBE7E7. */
/* Step 10
Align your .header text in the center, give it a padding of 32px on all sides, and set the background to #E0DDDD. */
