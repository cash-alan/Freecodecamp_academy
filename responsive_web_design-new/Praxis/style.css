/* Step 79
In the last project, you learned a little bit about borders and the border-color property.
All HTML elements have borders, though they're usually set to none by default. With CSS, you can control all aspects of an element's border, and set the border on all sides, or just one side at a time. For a border to be visible, you need to set its width and style.
In the .sleeve CSS rule, add the border-left-width property with the value 10px. */
/* Step 80
Borders have several styles to choose from. You can make your border a solid line, but you can also use a dashed or dotted line if you prefer. Solid border lines are probably the most common.
In the .sleeve CSS rule, add the border-left-style property with the value solid. */
/* Step 81
Your border should be visible now. If no color is set, black is used by default.
But to make your code more readable, it's better to set the border color explicitly.
In the .sleeve CSS rule, add the border-left-color property with the value black. */
/* Step 82
The border-left shorthand property lets you to set the left border's width, style, and color at the same time.
Here is the syntax:
`border-left: width style color;`
In the .sleeve CSS rule, replace the border-left-width, border-left-style, and border-left-color properties with the border-left shorthand property. The values for the width, style, and color of the left border should be the same. */
/* Step 83
Your marker is looking good. But to make it look even more realistic, you can change the border style to double solid borders.
For the border-left shorthand property, change the border style value from solid to double. */
/* Step 84
The black color of your border looks pretty harsh against the more transparent sleeve. You can use an alpha channel to lower the opacity of the black border.
For the border-left shorthand property, use the rgba function to set the color value to pure black with 75% opacity. */
