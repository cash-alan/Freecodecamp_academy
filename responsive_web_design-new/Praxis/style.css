/* Step 31
Now that you're familiar with secondary colors, you'll learn how to create tertiary colors. Tertiary colors are created by combining a primary with a nearby secondary color.
To create the tertiary color orange, update the rgb function in the .one CSS rule so that red is at the max value, and set green to 127. */
/* Step 32
Notice that, to create orange, you had to increase the intensity of red and decrease the intensity of the green rgb values. This is because orange is the combination of red and yellow, and falls between the two colors on the color wheel.
To create the tertiary color spring green, combine cyan with green. Update the rgb function in the .two CSS rule so that green is at the max value, and set blue to 127. */
/* Step 33
And to create the tertiary color violet, combine magenta with blue. Update the rgb function in the .three CSS rule so that blue is at the max value, and set red to 127. */
