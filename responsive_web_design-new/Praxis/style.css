/* Step 22
The goal now is to make the div not take up the entire width of the page. The CSS width property is perfect for this. Create a new type selector in the style sheet that gives your div element a width of 300px. */
/* Step 23
Comments in CSS look like this:
/ * comment here (no spaces)* /
In your style sheet, comment out the the line containing the background-color property and value, so you can see the effect of only styling div element. This will make the background white again. */
/* Step 24
Now use the existing div selector to set the background color of the div element to be burlywood. */
/* Step 25
Now it's easy to see that the text is centered inside the div element. Currently, the width of the div element is specified in pixels (px). Change the width property's value to be 80%, to make it 80% the width of its parent element (body). */
/* Step 26
Next, you want to center the div horizontally. You can do this by setting its margin-left and margin-right properties to auto. Think of the margin as invisible space around an element. Using these two margin properties, center the div element within the body element. */
/* Step 27
So far you have been using type selectors to style elements. A class selector is defined by a name with a dot directly in front of it, like this:
.class-name {
  styles
}
Change the existing div selector into a class selector by replacing div with a class named menu. */


body {
  /* background-color: burlywood; */
}

.menu {
  width: 80%;
  background-color: burlywood;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
}  

h1, h2, p {
    text-align: center;
}
