/* Step 29
Since the cafe's main product for sale is coffee, you could use an image of coffee beans for the background of the page.
Delete the comment and its contents inside the body type selector. Now add a background-image property and set its value to url(https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-cafe/beans.jpg). */
/* Step 34
Using your new flavor class as a selector, set the text-align property's value to left. */
/* Step 36 
Now align the text to the right for the elements with the price class. */
/* Step 38
The p elements are nested in an article element with the class attribute of item. You can style all the p elements nested anywhere in elements with a class named item like this:
.item p { }
Using the above selector, add a display property with value inline-block so the p elements behave more like inline elements. */
/* Step 39
That's closer, but the price didn't stay over on the right. This is because inline-block elements only take up the width of their content. To spread them out, add a width property to the flavor and price class selectors that have a value of 50% each. */
/* Step 40
Well that did not work. Styling the p elements as inline-block and placing them on separate lines in the code creates an extra space to the right of the first p element, causing the second one to shift to the next line. One way to fix this is to make each p element's width a little less than 50%.
Change the width value to 49% for each class to see what happens. */
/* Step 42
Now go ahead and change both the flavor and price class' widths to be 50% again. */
/* Step 46
If you make the width of the page preview smaller, you will notice at some point, some of the text on the left starts wrapping around to the next line. This is because the width of the p elements on the left side can only take up 50% of the space.
Since you know the prices on the right have significantly fewer characters, change the flavor class width value to be 75% and the price class width value to be 25%. */
/* Step 52
Something does not look right. You added the correct class attribute value to the p element with Donut as its text, but you have not defined a selector for it.
Since the flavor class selector already has the properties you want, just add the dessert class name to it. */
/* Step 54
You can give your menu some space between the content and the sides with various padding properties.
Give the menu class a padding-left and a padding-right with the same value 20px. */
/* Step 55
That looks better. Now try to add the same 20px padding to the top and bottom of the menu. */
/* Step 56
Since all 4 sides of the menu have the same internal spacing, go ahead and delete the four properties and use a single padding property with the value 20px. */
