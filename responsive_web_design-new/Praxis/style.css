/* Step 57
The current width of the menu will always take up 80% of the body element's width. On a very wide screen, the coffee and dessert appear far apart from their prices.
Add a max-width property to the menu class with a value of 500px to prevent it from growing too wide. */
/* Step 58
You can change the font-family of text, to make it look different from the default font of your browser. Each browser has some common fonts available to it.
Change all the text in your body, by adding a font-family property with the value sans-serif. This is a fairly common font that is very readable. */
/* Step 59
It is a bit boring for all the text to have the same font-family. You can still have the majority of the text sans-serif and make just the h1 and h2 elements different using a different selector.
Style both the h1 and the h2 elements so that only these elements' text use Impact font. */
/* Step 60
You can add a fallback value for the font-family by adding another font name separated by a comma. Fallbacks are used in instances where the initial is not found/available.
Add the fallback font serif after the Impact font. */
/* Step 61
Make the Est. 2020 text italicized by creating an established class selector and giving it the font-style property with the value italic. */
/* Step 63
The typography of heading elements (e.g. h1, h2) is set by default values of users' browsers.
Add two new type selectors (h1 and h2). Use the font-size property for both, but use the value 40px for the h1 and 30px for the h2. */
/* Step 68
The default properties of an hr element will make it appear as a thin light grey line. You can change the height of the line by specifying a value for the height property.
Change the height the hr element to be 3px. */
/* Step 69
Change the background color of the hr element to brown so it matches the color of the coffee beans. */
/* Step 70
Notice the grey color along the edges of the line. Those edges are known as borders. Each side of an element can have a different color or they can all be the same.
Make all the edges of the hr element the same color as the background of it using the border-color property. */
/* Step 71
Notice how the thickness of the line looks bigger? The default value of a property named border-width is 1px for all edges of hr elements. By changing the border to the same color as the background, the total height of the line is 5px (3px plus the top and bottom border width of 1px).
Change the height property of the hr to be 2px, so the total height of it becomes 4px. */
/* Step 73
To create a little more room around the menu, add 20px of space on the inside of the body element by using the padding property. */
/* Step 74
Focusing on the menu items and prices, there is a fairly large gap between each line.
Target all the p elements nested in elements with the class named item and set their top and bottom margin to be 5px. */
/* Step 75
Using the same style selector in the previous step, make the font size of the items and prices larger by using a value of 18px. */
/* Step 76
Changing the margin-bottom to 5px looks great. However, now the space between the Cinnamon Roll menu item and the second hr element does not match the space between the top hr element and the Coffee heading.
Add some more space by creating a class named bottom-line using 25px for the margin-top property. */
