# Syntax
You can add style to an element by specifying it in the style element and setting a property for it like this:
```css
element {
 property: value;
}
```
## Flexbox
Flexbox is a one-dimensional CSS layout approach that focuses on the flow of content. It offers the ability to control the way items are spaced and aligned within a container.
To set an element to use Flexbox, you give it a display property set to flex. Create a #gallery selector and give it that property.
Flexbox can be thought of as having two axes, the main axis and the cross axis. The main axis is determined by the flex-direction property. If flex-direction is set to row or row-reverse, the main axis is horizontal. If flex-direction is set to column or column-reverse, the main axis is vertical.
