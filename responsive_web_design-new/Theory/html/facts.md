## Box-model
By now, you should be familiar with the basic elements an HTML page should have.

In the CSS box model, every HTML element is treated as a box with four areas.
Imagine you receive a box from your favorite online retailer -- the content is the item in the box, or in our case, a header, paragraph, or image element.

The content is surrounded by a space called padding, similar to how bubble wrap separates an item from the box around it.
Think of the border like the cardboard box your item was shipped in.

Margin is the area outside of the box, and can be used to control the space between other boxes or elements.
Here the bottom element has a larger top margin, pushing it further down the page.
